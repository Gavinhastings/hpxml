The latest version of DOE's Home Energy Score provides the capability for an
HPXML import. This presents another use case. The details of the translation and
required HPXML elements 
`are documented <http://hescore-hpxml.readthedocs.org/>`_ 
along with that translator, which has been 
`released open source on GitHub <https://github.com/NREL/hescore-hpxml>`_. 
You can also determine the minimum data requirements for HEScore using the
